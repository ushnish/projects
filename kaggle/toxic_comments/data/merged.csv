Childhood Section - NPOV?
I feel that the childhood section of this article is biased in favour of Phelps.  It is littered with unsourced statements that were obviously added by either Phelps himself or someone else who knows him well such as his family/cult members.  The information on how his mother used to play piano for the pleasure of the neighbours or how he played cornet in the school band but later switched to bass horn is completely unnecessary and colours the section to sound more like a memoir than a biography.  I think this section should be stripped down to include only relevant details about his early life to ensure that the article maintains a neural point-of-view.  

This article is becoming a joke

It's my opinion that Phelps is simply TOO controversial a subject on whom to do an exhaustive encyclopedic biography of a living person.  I believe that 99% of Wikipedians have their hearts in the right places, but I'm very dismayed at the constant changes in this piece.  Nobody knows for sure the motivations of Fred Phelps, yet everyone continues to guess at them.  This in turn makes the entire article riddled with POV.  I propose stripping this article down to the bare minimum.  When Phelps has passed on, historians will be more likely to ascertain his impact on world culture; specifically in the United States.  As it stands now, nobody knows whether he is a religious zealot, grandstander, nut-case, or any combination thereof.  But people keep on guessing, and I simply don't believe that makes for a very good encyclopedia article.  

Disagree with stripping this article down to bare minimum.  He is one of the most controversial figures around today and deserves more detailed coverage.   

Detailed coverage does not mean the same thing as posting opinions.  Documented information or peer-reviewed critique are the key to preventing POV. See Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view - 

 I have to agree with Alex. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a news service or a celebrity gossip page. The article should be stripped down to basic facts which meet the standards of encyclopediac sources. This will make it easier to maintain a non point of view perspective. There are hundreds (at least) of other sites only a Google away which can provide juicier bits.  

Aging Fred
Would it be worth mentioning that most of the administration of the church has been taken over by Fred's daughter Shirley? In Louis Theroux's BBC2 documentary just screened, Fred did nothing but read out prewritten diatribe and seemed to have trouble answering how many children he had when asked. http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/noise/?id=louis_theroux  
Only if you can find a reliable source which says that Shirley has taken over day-to-day management of the church. If you have a source for that statement, go for it. '''''' (talk) 

Upon watching the documentary, I felt that Fred did not have trouble answering how many children he had, but was merely expressing irritation at the question, indicating that anyone who had done basic research would know not only how many children he had, but how many were still in regular contact with Fred. Whether that irritation was justified can only be answered by those who were present during Louis Theroux's stays in Topeka. John Warburton 
I think (OR/POV) Theroux was trying to establish whether Phelps counted the 4 dissenting children as his, and Phelps saw this and tried to avoid answering either way.  In any case, I don't consider that the documentary presented any credible evidence loss of faculties (though that doesn't mean that he's mentally stable). 08:42, 3 October""",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0105535565,0.00017163504,0.0009381478,0.00014211847,0.0010227233,0.00027161493

Paragraphs about major airlines retiring the 727

24,46ac13b15fe463bb,"Scarab bug tracking software 

Yesterday I was reading through Comparison of issue tracking systems and followed the link Scarab.

This lead to a disambiguation page. The page listed:
An open source bugtracker software

This text and the links contained are extremely confusing. The disambiguation template clearly states that if an internal link (such as the one from the comparison) leads to this disambiguation page, you should change that incoming link it to point to the appropriate article. Since the article did not exist and since the item in the list for the application was confusing, I decided to create a Scarab Bug Tracking page.

To make things as seamless as possible, I quickly copied the text from the old item into the new article, intending to improve the article as soon as it was created. Before I could make my modifications, you changed the content to link back to the list or something similarly stupid. (I would go back and read exactly what you changed it to, but you deleted the page, so I cant check the history)

After I reverted your changes and then made some minor changes to the content, I put the page up for move proposal to Scarab (software) to be more consistent with pages that are from disambiguation pages.

This morning I came back to the page to check if it had moved, but it was gone! I assumed that maybe it was just moved and that the old page no longer existed. I poked around the Move proposal list, and the disambiguation page that I had originally edited (Still in that state) and could no longer find the page.

As a person unfamiliar with all Wikipedia bullshit politics and confusing processes, it took me a while to figure out exactly what happened to the page I had created less than 24 hours ago. Finally I found it, the person who originally ruined my short article after less than ONE MINUTE of my edit, - you -, deleted it!

In your comments, you did not explain the reason for deletion, you only sited A3. To anyone but a Wikipedia user extremely familiar with deletion, this would be meaningless. An article too short would have been much better. After digging around a lot, I found that it was a reference to the third reason an _A_rticle could be deleted. Hence, the A3. You should AT LEAST link to that so people that arent familiar with Wikipedia jargon can figure out what that means without searching through piles and piles of horribly disorganized Wikipedia-politics-ridden pages.

Considering that the content I posted stated that it was a stub, the time it takes to delete an article, and the relative freshness of the page, it makes you look like a deleting troll. If you thought that the page was clearly grounds for deletion, you should have put that inside the article or something and let it stand for a good 48 hours before finalizing the deletion.

I agree that Wikipedia should not be laden with content-free articles, but having cyclic links from the disambiguation page, to the bug tracking software page, and back is worse. If there is no article to link to, there should be no link.

The only things that you achieved by deleting the page is: made yourself stand out as a stereotypical Wikipedia troll/nazi/zealot, put off a Wikipedia contributor from continuing to improve the quality of Wikipedia, wasted a lot of my time to investigate what the hell happened to the page I created, and broke at least two internal links.

You violated the spirit of Wikipedia and smashed what little hope I still had for the Wikipedia community. Congratulations, asshole.

""""how you would classify any title given by leading newspapers as """"emotional""""?""""
 Here are some of the headlines from Times of India today: """"Future of Indian bowling is bleak"""", """"Ranbir Kapoor is hard to please"""", """"Why Indian men rape"""". That doesn't mean we are going to include things like these in the intros of the articles on Indian cricket team, Ranbir Kapoor or Indian people. Facts, not opinions, should be included in the intros, plain and simple.

 """"Delhi tops the list in crimes among all states of India, followed by Maharashtra""""
 You haven't read the article you linked to. Quote from the article: """"UP accounted for the highest 33.9% of the total crime reported in India last year followed by Andhra Pradesh (13.9%) and TN (11.4%).""""
 It does say that as a city, Delhi, followed by Mumbai, tops the crime list among the """"mega cities"""". Like I said - such a statistic is meaningless unless you consider per capita. Please read my comment again.
 You cannot say that """"Tamil Nadu is more crime-oriented than Goa because TN is #3 on the list, far ahead of Goa."""" If the population of Goa is 10 times less than that of TN, it won't be surprising if 1000 cases were reported in TN as opposed to only 100 in Goa. Delhi and Mumbai are the most populous cities in India, so it's not surprising that the highest number of crimes are repored in these cities.
 Another example: India's GDP is higher than that of Australia, Canada, Singapore and several other countries  that doesn't mean that India is the among the richest countries in the world. The per capita figures are the true indicator.

 """"If so then even London is capital of UK does it mean crimes in London could be ignored?""""
 That's a straw man argument. Who said anything about crimes being ignored?  The demographics section of the article on Delhi already mentions that """"Delhi accounted for the highest percentage (16.2%) of the crimes reported in 35 Indian cities with populations of one million or more"""" and """"Delhi accounts for 15.4% of crime against women in Indian cities."""" We are talking about inclusion of POV statements like """"rape and crime capital"""" in the intro of the article. If you want to add a section to the article, go ahead. See New York City#Crime for an example.

 """"Livemint is also not a valid news paper or recognized source like TOI or The Hindu""""
 Mint is published by HT Media (of Hindustan Times fame), in collaboration with the The Wall Street Journal. Anyway, that's not what we are discussing here.

""""TOI has given latest stats (2012). Hence your info is out dated compared to mine.""""
 Nope. Like I said, you haven't read the article you are referring to. It's dated 2011. And I've already discussed the article contents above.

 """"new comers should be made aware of these to protect their lives by taking caution or avoiding the city""""
 See WP:AGENDA. If you want to launch an awareness drive about the crimes in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, or states like UP, Andhra and Tamil Nadu, please start a blog.

 """"u are worried about all proofs""""
 """"threatening me to stop me
 """"interfering in freedom / rights to express""""
 Please stop the Wikipedia:Drama. I am an Indian, but I wasn't born in Delhi, neither have I lived in Delhi.  Torreslfchero and Anna Frodesiak aren't even Indians. So, there is no reason why should we be """"worried"""".

Hi, I've edited the China/Temp page:

 restored the table per the WikiProject Countries page
 put in a """"disclaimer""""
 move the brief history of China into the section for history

Although I have rewritten some of the text, I think I have not really touched it's contents. Roadrunner, Fred, what do you think?  00:52 Aug 3, 2002 (PDT)

It's less objectionable, but I still have a small problem with it.  The basic problem is that is seems to imply the the PRC """"owns"""" say the history of Tang Dynasty.  Also,
it doesn't really take into account current events.  One of
the things that the PRC government has been doing in the past year has been to """"delink"""" the concept of the PRC from the concept of China.  You can see this in the response to Chen Shuibian that was issued today where the PRC was
went out of its way to avoid identifying the PRC with China.

I'll probably drop out of the discussion for a few days and
let other people comment (as well as try to articulate better what still bothers me about the page).

 User:Roadrunner

 Ok, we're moving towards a solution, so that's good. As for the Tang dynasty (though I think you mean it more genral), I think that Taiwan did not form part of the Tang empire. Anyway, there's nothing against mentioning the Tang dynasty at Taiwan as well.

 We may indeed specifically include (in the history? header? """"disclaimer""""?) that the PRC avoids linking its name to China. Then again, it may de-link it formally, but all those people around the world will continue to associate the two. 

 I'll await your remaining problems with the contents, confident we'll end up with an article that satisfies the both of us (and, hopefully, """"everybody else"""").  13:07 Aug 5, 2002 (PDT)

Guys, after reading this tedious list of conversation, my sugguestion of the best way out of the naming convention of China is using those by native speakers of Chinese. As a native speaker of several dialects of Chinese, I make the following table which should help: 

How native Chinese speakers refer to:
Speakers from
Mainland China
Taiwan
HongKong
Macau

Referring to China (Mainland)
China
Mainland (daliu)
Mainland or Zhongguo Daliu (chong-gua-da-lok in Cantonese)
Mainland

Taiwan
Taiwan or Taiwan Province (the more official tone)
Taiwan
Taiwan
Taiwan

China (the culture etc., non-political issue
China
China
China
China

Most Chinese, regardless of where they are from, care less about the naming convention but some Taiwanese (like my buddy who is gonna marry next month) DO NOT WANT Mainland China to annex Taiwan and had bad impression on Chen Shuibian.

KT2

 Knowing what the Chinese call it is certainly interesting, but what is important is what the English-language people call it. 

I'm with Jeronimo. I also thought all of this already had been resolved  China should be the main article of the PRoC. It doesn't matter what they officially call it or want it to be called. English speakers call it China in overwhelming numbers. This is also the conventional short form used by the CIA and the UN and we have decided that that is what we will use for country names here. If we don't stick to that then we are expressly taking sides in political naming issues. The fact that the PRoC is currently trying to dissociate their government from """"China"""" (which seems counter intuitive for a totalitarian regime..) is an interesting thing to mention in the article on the PRoC at China. If we change the name of the article to follow political correctness of the PRoC that is an express act of support for their policy. I for one say we defer such naming matters to higher authorities such as the CIA Factbook, the UN and especially what is most commonly used by English speakers. True they are POV institutions but transcribing what they use is a passive and not express act of POV. Wikipedia is not in the business to decide what the names of nations are  other institutions are far better suited at this highly charged topic. I also think the disclaimer is way too long and bold should be replaced by italics.

 A Brief History *
The """"ID Cabal"""" or """"IDCab"""" meme was started by blocked user Moulton on Wikipedia Review. It has been taken up with gusto by Lara Love, Cla68, and others. Now Kelly has embraced it. There has been an Rfc (started by members of the Intelligent Design Wikiproject) to get people to cease this bad-faith smearing, but it didn't get very far. The three most supported views were basically """"labels are bad"""" """"waste of time"""" and """"WP Not a Battelground"""". all of which might indicate that labeling people and using any excuse to attack others with that label is bad, but the Rfc was a waste of time. I presume by now you've read my initial paragrah and the linked edits, and see taht my post had nothing to do with intelligent design; that I addressed two editors who had been warring, and Kelly chose to personalize the dispute - see reported by MastCell (Result: Declined because of lack of consensus)

Following up on this surprising tidbit, I determined from your User Contributions page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Youreallycan) that of your 1,057 edits between 21:35 26 November 2011 and 02:27 22 December 2011, 29% were on User Talk pages, 27% on other Talk pages, and 25% on various Wikipedia internal discussion pages, including 39 edits on Articles For Deletion, 65 on Administrators' Noticeboards, and 34 Help Desk.

 Techno Viking 

A video taken at a free love rally featuring a large """"Viking"""" like man momentarily restrains a rowdy bystander only to then begin dancing to the techno playing in the background. The video has circulated widely on the internet.  Preceding unsigned comment added by 123.100.99.73   
I know the video, but there need to be more reliable sources to say its a meme/phenomena. As such, it's just a well-watched YouTube video.  (t) 
 The Impossible Quiz (a.k.a. SHOOP DAH WHOOP) 

It's not the game itself that is the meme, it's a part within it. The three most popular quotes are:

1. """"I'm a chargin' mah laser""""

2. """"I'm a firin' mah laser""""

3. """"SHOOP DAH WHOOP""""

I believe that the meme originated elsewhere. The Impossible Quiz came after the """"Shoop dah woop"""" came around.

114,f41dad7f70a10f6b,"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith.

The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me.

I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved.

I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. 

I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. 

As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.002181969,0.0002869304,0.00053689216,0.00017256975,0.0005559874,0.00034563505

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for thirty days, effective thirty days after the issuance of this opinion. It is further ordered that, prior to seeking reinstatement a",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.057477325,0.00037236212,0.0027480337,0.00041939414,0.005000009,0.0010894373

'As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk) '

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please.

 Add-in of old material or add to new page 

This edit was definately a great improvement, the only thing is it stripped out some information that I think was good. How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:

West Campus
The West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:
The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. 
The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. 
The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. 
The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. 
The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.
The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.
The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. 
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. 
The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.
The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100'x125'x89').

Damn, I'm not getting notified about these talk-page messages. Do you know how I switch email notifications on for such responses? Yes, I've done a lot of work there, but am tightly constrained in how much I can reveal regarding the sources of any so-called """"original research"""" material. Suffice it to say that I was privileged to work in the Dept of Physics at Auckland University (NZ), aged 19, as a research assistant (40+ years ago), where I made friends with a few young doctoral students, one of whom was researching gravitational waves. I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other """"big names"""" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR  could be a very big year for physics.

3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses.
4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000.
5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified.
6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. .

255,39ff1c7db3f306ae,", yes what a great game!!! From what I kept up with from live commentary from Eurosport, I could tell it was a great game. Unfortunately my university studies will get in the way of all the Champions League games, at least for the group stage as over here in Toronto they start at 2:45pm, where my classes are scheduled. You have it lucky in Itsly where you can watch it after work! Very upset about it but what are you gonna do. I could watch a re run of the game, but I can't quite ever get into it because I already know what happens, it's not fun to watch anymore with all suspense gone. (I like shouting at the TV screen) You probably know the feeling hahaha. Highlights are he best bet, but I know it doesn't show the full story of the game. So I can't banter much, but what a game it would have been I'm sure. I talked to my brother about it though, who had the luxury of watching the game and he said that if it wasn't for Buffon, it would be a whole different story. I love to see Buffon do well and still show people that despite his age he is still a top 3 goalkeeper at least! This just goes to show that you can't doubt a team's Champions League performance based on his they are doing in their domestic league. As a true fan, you are always rough on your team, but always stay by them through thick and thin. As you've said, this should be a great confidence boost for Juve and can hopefully channel it towards Serie A and further CL games, as there is still a long way to go! Hopefully Juve can win the title for a 5th straight and prove to all the people that it's Roma or Inter's time for the Scudetto in their place haha!

It hadn't been getting hit hard enough to warrant protection recently (I know, surprising considering the subject matter); default should be to unprotection. It just seems a bit harsh to do that after an IP made a good faith edit. Auntie E. """,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0023694367,0.00025834018,0.00052095257,0.00016122003,0.0005459551,0.0003181084

Now both Jayron32 and Fram are having memory lapses about how they did what they did, we are lucky to have diffs that can't lie. Fram's deletion conceals both my page and its history, that he uses to count the contributions. Fram says that the contribution by Baseball Bugs that Fram also deleted was """"minor"""". Is that supposed to mean """"unworthy""""? When Baseball Bugs posts to my page and the post is sensible, as it was, then no third person may delete it. But to Jayron32 and Fram, BB's post is merely collateral damage. Access to my deleted page, which I have asked for and been denied, will reveal that I was interrupted in the process of scanning the Ref. Desk archive. Anyone can do that because it's publically accessible. I became a humble recipient of The Reference Desk Barnstar (scroll up to see it) when I showed objective results. The first result showed Jayron32's contribution of references at RD/M to be among the highest, which likely gave Jayron32 satisfaction. That is understandable but I and many others cautioned that the measurement does not assess the quality of answers. The software I use may be improved but it would lose all credibility of objectivity if I allowed it to be biassed by anyone's feeling of being flattered or attacked by its output. @Fram, if you want AGF then stop hiding the page you deleted and it will be seen to be not just about Jayron32, it doesn't even contain the word """"mistake"""", and it has a portion still under construction.

According to Simon Schama's book The Power of Art, Guernica was painted in response to an article that Picaso saw in an French newspaper. The first line suggests that he was already working on the project when the bombs fell. He had agreed to do 'a politically minded painting' for a 1937 Paris Fair, but he had not decided what he was going to do until after the events in Geurnica unfolded. It was a front page photograph of the inferno that inspired the work.

 

""""Quite possibly apocryphal""""
I cut this from the article.

A story, quite possibly apocryphal, circulates about Guernica. During World War II, a German officer sees a copy of the painting for the first time, in the presence of Picasso.  In a wondering tone he asks Picasso """"Did you do this?"""" and Picasso replies: """"No, you did.""""

If it is """"quite possibly apocryphal"""" and we have no attribution or citation, it does not belong in the article.   | Talk 02:33, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Except that this is extremely widely believed and noted.  I recall hearing the equivalent when I was at the Prado. -  02:40, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Then someone should be able to find a citation at least of the anecdote being told. (& was Guernica ever in the Prado? In the early 80s it was in an annex to the Prado and then was moved to the Reina Sofia, no?)   | Talk 07:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)
Duh, yeah that is what I meant to say. It has been 4 years since I was there.  Yes, I would think someone could find a source for that being a common anecdote. -  13:32, Dec 14, 2004 (UTC)

The most specific version I could find as that Picasso is supposed to have said this in 1937, replying to German ambassador Otto Abetz, as he was visiting Picasso's studio. Then there are versions that have Picasso handing out postcards (sometimes autographed, even) to Germans while making this quip, but the most popular is probably the one that uses an anonymous German officer bringing/seeing a postcard/photograph. None of these sites mention sources, of course, but this one has an interesting addition:
Picasso himself probably had contributed to Barr's and others' perception of him having behaved rather boldly throughout the war when, immediately following the liberation, he told an American correspondent for Newsweek magazine that on the day when a German army officer had recognized a sketch of Guernica pinned to the wall of his studio and had asked him, """"Did you do that?,"""" Picasso coldly had replied, """"No, you did."""" 
Now the tale originates with Picasso himself and is told to Newsweek, which makes this version much more credible than the others, since it's hard to see how a response to Abetz or a group of officers would not be better documented, while it's equally hard to see how a reply to a single anonymous German officer could be known at all. Unfortunately, no other site corroborates the Newsweek detail. I've sent a mail to the Newsweek editors and I'll keep you posted. If someone could check out some Picasso biographies to check whether they mention the anecdote (and what source they give, if any), that would be great.  13:14, 2005 Apr 25 (UTC)
 We can certainly cite the fact that Picasso himself told a (possibly apocryphal) story. It makes the line his, even if it's not clear he really said it in the claimed circumstances.   | Talk 16:05, Apr 26, 2005 (UTC)
 Yes, if Picasso really told it. So far, no sources are backing up that website (or even just repeating that version), so I'm not too keen on it. Otherwise the whole thing is just as apocryphal as before.  · Talk 16:46, 2005 Apr 26 (UTC)

 Nudity? 

I reverted this from Category:Paintings containing nudity to Category:Paintings. Clearly, the fact that one naked female human breast is visible in the painting is a very minor fact about the painting; no one by a very weird obsessive would look for it there.

The most glaring of them is the army's suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the Arjun's performance.

In fact, the army has already accepted the Arjun for introduction into service, based upon its driving and firing performance over the years. After firing trials in summer 2006, the trial report (written by the army) said: """"The accuracy and consistency of the Arjun has been proved beyond doubt.""""

The ongoing trials in Pokhran that the army is citing are Accelerated Usage cum Reliability Trials (AUCRT). In these, two Arjun tanks were run almost non-stop for 3,000 kilometres, not to judge performance, but to evaluate the tank's requirement of spare parts, fuel and lubricants during its entire service life.""""

 A tag has been placed on Philadelphia Cares about Fairmount Park Day requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

As the nominator, I want to thank you for taking the time to do an in-depth review of the article.  I was guilty of sinking in unsigned responses to some of your comments in order to communicate progress.  The article was renominated in September after three intensive days of full time effort to address all of the concerns from the prior GA review (which was summarily rejected without any interaction.)  I thought that a featured article should certainly meet GA criteria and we designated the article as the August 2010 Wikiproject Universities collaboration of the month.  The result was an improved article including many new footnotes, mostly to source the fact that the notable alumni actually attended Cornell. To give the collaboration a valid end point I nominated the article for GA, and renominated it after addressing the listed concerns, not aware of the defects that you uncovered.

 Formatting of references 

I see there's been a lot of discussion on this page about sourcing, which is good, but in the current form it's still hard to actually tell how reliable information is. Most of the links go to fan sites, which aren't necessarily suitable sources. I realise that in many cases  those sites list information from more reliable sources (e.g. RIAA, SoundScan, Billboard, UWC), but there's no way of telling that from the references. Would be good to restructure them to more accurately reflect their contents  e.g. for the stuff from the MariahDaily InfoZone pages, have references that say """"Billboard Magazine Date x quoted by MariahDaily"""" (that's not the exact format, but you get the general idea).

372,ddd6af18901ec6d5,"Holby series/characters 

Hi there,
I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller. 
As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names.
I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards). 
Let me know what you think - it may be that the complete removal of wards may be the easiest way forward!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0022026896,0.00028548855,0.00053264975,0.00017180761,0.0005573093,0.00034488164

Despite your delirious notions that homosexuality is a """"disease"""" to be """"cured"""", the fact of the matter is that it isn't and it can't be, the more scientific studies are done on the subject, the more your lies disintegrate when exposed to the daylight.

Anyway, if you could please not resort to your usual behavior towards the truth, which is usually trying to delete it when it doesn't serve your purpose, I would appreciate it.

Anyway, the reason I reverted CC80's edit is because this is a section devoted towards """"Behavior modification"""", I really don't see how it's """"unbalanced"""", it mentions the techniques that have been tried (and failed) to """"cure"""" a """"disease"""" that doesn't exist, and I cited it properly with respected organizations, such as the APA.

Thank you, good night, and may the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless you all.

There is certainly other info on that article that is unnecessary, but I do believe that it is useful and interesting information, or at the very least I don't understand what makes it less relevant than something like elevation or especially median household income. The 2000 census info itself may not be current, but I feel that the growth of the city is relevant to the subject - certainly the growth rate of a city is a useful piece of information?

 In my opinion, the three lists you just mentioned need improvement to reach the standards of the Oregon and Washington lists (that is completely independent of the fact that I promoted those two lists to FL statusthey simply contain more facts, stronger leads, more references, etc).  I think that a single table is more appropriate as it can be sorted and the order of sections seem somewhat arbitrary by making some symbols more important than others. Also, I believe it is crucial to separate official and unofficial symbols. I have no problem with having a table for the """"Unofficial symbols"""" sectionit just happens that the Oregon and Washington lists only have a couple so it was easier to construct prose than tables. I know nothing about Governors lists, but I believe some have been promoted to FL status so it is probably worth examining those. Hopefully I will get around to improving the Maryland, Kentucky and Indiana symbols lists. In the meantime (just to make the FLC nomination process easier and for the sake of consistency) I would mimic the Oregon and Washington symbols lists since they have been promoted much more recently than the other three.

I question the very supposition that natural rights should be conjoined with legal rights, as I have recently brought up again below.  

The reasoning here seems to me to suggest that there is connection between the two (or at least to suggest in some way that there SHOULD or OUGHT to be a connection); this is a moral argument, not a legal one.  The POV is not neutral.  This question comes up in the very opening paragraph of SEP entry for legal rights, the issue: """"Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of rights, principally moral rights""""  [].  We need to talk about what is being inferred here by these two entries being together. I too believe the entries need to separated, as to link them suggests a direct link between legal and moral rights. I do not believe that there is connection, although some people think that there should be.  Reason and passion are separate under the law.

 Let's play nice; 

I wrote the article on Lepore syndrome that you started, not trying to be childish just to make a point and I see you changed the name to Hemoglobin Lepore syndrome, that's fast. My childish behavior, temper tantrums, solve nothing. I prefer not to engage in childish tit for tat.

So I'm asking nice as per WP:Civil, please do not arbitrarily butcher what I created, I'm also a big boy I know how to read Wikipedia's policies, the policies are not set in stone and the pictures do not all have to be crammed on the right, if there is only one picture yes more than one it looks better to stagger them. I don't have the time right now but there is a Wikipedia policy about breaking Wikipedia policy. I actually prefer to edit history articles. The article I Did on Eating disorders I believe came out well as did the one on Anorexia nervosa, as another editer made mention about """"dissection"""" that's not very nice and not keeping in the collaborative effort as it was based upon your views and interpretions. 

Things like this need attention:
The article on the thyroid gland was labelled as part of the """"endocinal jubachina system"""" for two and a half years. The article on Birth weight is inexplicably called Birth Mass, nobody refers to """"birth mass"""" it's also written poorly.

Plus, if you remove the different FAs in the Filipino footy categories, most of those which are left are essentially extensions of the varsity teams. For example, Diliman FC are for UP Fighting Maroons alumni, same for Mendiola United FC and the San Beda Red Lions. Most players of the national team are varsity team players.

 Then the legal issues with LucasArts  this is far a more notable part of the history of the project than an alleged GPL violation many many years later  and their amicable resolution and ongoing development of the project. (That's just page 1)
 Then cooperation from games companies, sharing of source code and in some cases offering the games as freeware (a section of prose on this would provide context and make the long lists of later in the article more meaningful). ScummVM developers evening working with companies under NDAs. Merging the SCI engine goes from April fools joke to actual reality many years later. 
 page 4 of the article talks about the Mystic GPL issue that already has been given undue weight in this article, an issue best solved by rebalancing the article with more prose. The article mentions touch support added for WebOS that might be generalized and also mentions the Google Summer of Code.

1)  http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-04-13/news/27061643_1_celibacy-homosexuality-abuse  I'm sure you'll go though the article but the sentence that shows why we need to delete the celibacy part of the argument is the first sentence (which also supports the need to give it a name of a cris of homosexuality) which states, """"Celibacy is not the cause behind the child sex abuse scandal that has shattered the priesthood and imploded the Catholic Church.  Blame homosexuality, the Vatican's second in command claims.""""
2)  http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html   """"I maintain it has been a homosexual crisis all along. The evidence is all on my side, though there is a reluctance to let the data drive the conclusion. But that is a function of politics, not scholarship.""""  Bill from the Catholic League so I think from an objective POV we can say that it has been a crisis of homosexuality with a few other contributing factors but that Celibacy, and Seminary training were not one of them.

I mean that is quite a strong assertion to make don't you think?  the idea that you can blame an institution like the Catholic Seminary for a series of generalized horrific crimes.  I don't think we can say although the abuse was pervasive, we don't have enough evidence to say that it was institutional (a byproduct of an organization, in this case the Catholic Seminary).

Society is capable of suppressing genetically based tendencies, but when it comes to war, most cultures actually fuel the flames. We deliberately instill nationalistic pride in our children, and we teach them to assume roles and follow orders  all characteristics of the good soldier. In addition, we """"deindividuate"""" people by giving them uniforms; we diffuse responsibility by having them use weapons in teams; we dehumanize enemies by labeling them heathens, animals and so on. Throw in financial incentives, some propaganda and a charismatic leader or two, and we become more antlike than ever.""""
A Partner in Shaping an Assertive Foreign Policy
Elisabeth Bumiller. New York Times. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: Jan 7, 2004. *:pg. A.1Ms. Rice was in similar lock step with Mr. Bush, and Mr. Cheney, on going to war with Iraq, senior advisers to the president said, and served as an implementer of the president's wishes. Richard Haass, the former director of policy planning at the State Department who is now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, recalls going to see Ms. Rice in July 2002, well before the president began making a public case for ousting Mr. Hussein, to discuss with Ms. Rice the pros and cons of making Iraq a priority.
Basically she cut me off and said, 'Save your breath  the president has already decided what he's going to do on this,'  Mr. Haass said.

Okay, thanks, that's clear, I will action that when I get time. It is not really that I am attacking anybody, but that I am defending myself again the attacks of User:Bobrayner against articles that I spent a lot of time on (without pay) to inform readers. The main objection I have to User:Bobrayner's editing is that he edits articles without any proper knowledge of the subject and then substitutes his own interpretation, the result being a bunch of errors. Let me give a recent example to illustrate. In the article on the Marxian concept of Surplus product, User:Bobrayner recently wiped out the sentence """"The concept plays an important role in Das Kapital"""", but for no good reason. After all, Marx writes that: """"Since the production of surplus-value is the determining purpose of capitalist production, the size of a given quantity of wealth must be measured, not by the absolute quantity produced, but by the relative magnitude of the surplus product."""" Cap. Vol. 1, Penguin, pp. 338-339. This is absolutely central to Marx's argument. The concept is discussed in more detail across about ten pages and at least five places in Capital Vol. 2, and again in at least 11 different places in Capital Vol. 3. So it is an important theoretical concept in Das Kapital. Yet User:Bobrayner wipes that out! Next, I write """"Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics, surplus economics as well as sociology and other social sciences. User:Bobrayner wipes out surplus economics, archaeology, sociology and other social sciences so that the  sentence now reads: Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics.[2] political anthropology, cultural anthropology, economic anthropology (in that case, it should really be AND economic anthropology). However, scholars familiar with the concept know quite well that this concept is used exactly in the way that I said, and references can be provided for this (in fact I quote plenty examples in the rest of the article). However, if I provided references, then User:Bobrayner will no doubt wipe them out on the ground that I am offering a quote farm or some such thing. User:Bobrayner next wipes out the statement that For most of the history of civil society, the meaning of the surplus product was fairly obvious and clear. It consisted of (1) that part of what workers produced (products, offspring or services) which they had to hand over to the chief, the landowner, the lord, or the state, as a tax, rent or tribute, and (2) incidental surplus produce, in excess of the producers' own requirements, which was traded for other goods. However, the meaning of surplus product becomes less clear in capitalist society (see below). There is nothing particularly controversial about this statement, and it could be referenced without any problem; I explain the reasoning in subsequent sections of the article. Next, User:Bobrayner wipes out the statement that Since trade always involves two or more parties with their own interests in the matter, the meanings of that trade can be construed in different ways by different stakeholders, and they can evolve across time. If that is the case, the economic meanings of trade are never completely fixed once and for all. Such ambiguities gave rise to many different interpretations of what """"fair trade"""" or """"just trade""""(and therefore trade of benefit to society) might be considered to be. For a long time, it was very difficult for economic theorists to separate out the moral judgement about different kinds of trade, from a scientific appraisal of the actual objective processes of trade, because commerce was dominated by legal codes and by religion. For any scholar of the subject, this is quite obvious, but nevertheless User:Bobrayner wipes it out. After wiping out a few more small  clarifying bits, User:Bobrayner modifies the sentence The existence of a surplus product normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour and adds, In Marxism, the existence of a """"surplus product"""" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour. But this doesnt even distinguish between Marx and all sorts of Marxisms or Marxists or other historians using this concept.  When I write carefully, With the bourgeois state, taxpayers typically have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any public criticism of the state  that the critic  could be fined, imprisoned or killed, then User:Bobrayner changes that to With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally.

Say what?

I decide to check out the AfD articles, not something I normally get involved in. I come to an article for deletion, A Course in Miracles (book). I look over it  I see it's been documented and footnoted almost to the very last comma. I observe a tremendous argument ensuing over one word, """"cult"""", that's being interpreted multiple ways. Multiple editors are squabbling over whether User:Ste4k is being """"POV"""" for using it. I change the wording to eliminate the troublesome word while meeting what I see as the intent of the original author of the quote, Garrett. I think I do an adequate if not very eloquent job. I go to a lot of effort to explain what and why I made the change, citing the dictionary, etc. I do screw up and forget to sign some of my work, which you helpfully catch and fix.

I then vote in the AfD to delete the article but to keep its content and merge it into the main article. I explain my reasoning, but without going into detail as to my views of both articles as they presently stand. If I had, I would have said something along the lines that the main article flows well and is comprehensive; I think it's generally well written. At the same time, it screams out for about 200 {{fact}} tags. It's not clear to me how reliable it is. The book article, by contrast, is not as pretty and, as the principal author herself more or less says, reads like a U.S. District Court decision. There's a reason judges' decisions are not high literature and that's because they're shooting for reliability and precision, not memorable prose. There's considerable overlap between both articles with much discussion as to whether there should be a book article and a movement article or just one combined article; there's even discussion as to whether the word """"movement"""" should be used. It seems to me as it all this talk of different articles is putting the cart before the horse (reliability), so I vote """"merge and delete"""" so that the overall Wikipedia coverage can get fixed and streamlined with some sort of consensus built.

Now I wake up and I find that you've spent hours during the night sarcastically mutilating your own article. It appears that one word, """"cult"""", and my good faith editing of its usage may have been your tipping point to go into a frenzy. That or my one vote in the AfD process. If you don't like my cult edit, just reverse it and explain how I got it wrong.

Then there's this message on my talk page:
""""I'm not originally from the U.S. I was born in Kharkov. In our country, we beat liars, and if one wants to eat, they work.

And as for Wikipedia, being flawed, it certainly is that. It is profoundly flawed in terms of the reliability of some of its material. In fact, if so many millions of people didn't use it, I'd say forget about it. But the fact is, Wikipedia is very important and growing in importance everyday. Every day, more people abandon traditional sources of reliable information such as Britannica and turn to Wikipedia. Every month, Wikipedia's Google rankings move up higher and are often in the top 5 for a given search. The fact that so many other sites such as answers.com mirror the content makes what's written in Wikipedia seem all the more """"reliable"""" since to the undiscerning, it looks like other sites are agreeing with Wikipedia.

So like it or not, Wikipedia is here to stay and further grow in importance. You can fume and I can fret, but our children and grandchildren will use it more and more as their first source of knowledge, reliable or not. That almost pessimistic view of Wikipedia's growing role is what motivates me  not some idealistic, Woodstockian notion that """"information longs to be free"""" or so much of the other idealistic stuff that motivates thousands of mostly earnest, smart but very young editors on this project.

656,249735a2af2480b2,"Hi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.

So let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.

Now, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.

The 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.
The 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.

So, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%
And for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%

So the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.

Hedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.

Therefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0022216907,0.0002766462,0.00052798114,0.00016777811,0.0005445721,0.00033356898

 1904? 
Hey all, another alumnus here.  As we were all taught, the fraternity was founded in 1904.  However, just today I came across something peculiara book with the following passage: """"In the fall of '94 a chapter of Pi Kappa Phi was established and then in the spring of '95 our chapter of Sigma Nu was installed....  Although Pi Kappa Phi has more than twice our number, yet we will fight to 'count her for game.  

Fair enough, except for the fact that this book that was published in 1896!  The book is The Delta of Sigma Nu, Vol. 13, which is an annual history published by that fraternity.  The article in question, """"The Founding of Beta Tau - N.C. A. & M."""", about their new chapter on the campus of the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts in Raleigh, NC, can be found in Section 13, pages 911.  You'll find it here on Google Books.

Can anyone shed light on this?  Might the author have actually been referring to Pi Kappa Alpha?  Or perhaps to an unrelated, now-defunct fraternal organization?  Thoughts?

Mistake in vandalism reversal

I reverse the changes also added to the article by the unsigned individual. There is some content here that might be worth retaining and incorporating into the article. 
However, 
 the same individual also removed my comments from the talk page. This amounts to censorship and suggests at minimum bad faith in regard to the wikipedia process of revising articles.
 the new content was a quick cut and paste from some previous text as shown by the fact the section left its original references at the end and a """"summary"""". As I noted above not all this new material is inappropriate.

There are some good individual public schools, but the greater educational system has flaws (not just the public educational system FYI, homeschooling can be just as bad). You can see that I have Pirate Pride, and if you look up Port Charlotte High School, you will read it is a public school. In fact, I've had several conservative teachers, as well as liberal ones). However, people have a right to their opinions, and if I'm to edit at Conservapedia, I should do so in a manner that is acceptable to the majority of the community there; a lot of what they call """"public school culture"""" I would call flaws in modern society. Likewise, I should edit Wikipedia in a way that is acceptable to the Wikipedia community. As should you. Indeed, political issues and Wiki drama aside, I think you have good intentions, but have a compulsive urge to engage in behavior at odds with Wikipedia's policies. You seem to have an obsession with Conservapedia. I've yet to see you actually contribute to any articles here. I sometimes have to question whether you're here to build an encyclopedia or turn Wikipedia into the next RationalWiki. 

Back on topic, my biggest problem with your behavior here is that you seem rather clueless. That not intended to be a random insult, but seriously. Wikipedia does not need proof that someone is doing something to block them, but rather consensus. You seem to be thumbing your nose at the system here, kind of like haha, you can't prove it, so you can't block me, haha. Admins will likely use that against you.

You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text  which means allowing other people to modify it  then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later.""""

I've removed things that make claims to facts (her nationality, etc), but have allowed the """"youtube research"""" to stay. Someone suggested an AfD for her, which I think would be wrong, her notability likely warrants the article, I'm just surprised at the lack of reliable information. If you want, make comments directly to Magibon Talk, we are already discussing some of the issues there.

 Lead 

What's there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize, which the case at Salvatore Giunta is not. It simply copies whole sentances from the body text. As an editor, we have to assess the article as it currently stands, and not any hypothetical future stance. If the article grows, then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. In any case, the lead section I favored does indeed summarize the most important part: the MOH.
In any case, did you read WP:LEAD? The lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject, but assert thier claim to notability.

it is inarguable you're trying to improve the exposure lesser-known bands, whose musical merits are FAR inferior to Elton John's. That is not how music works. I have never ever seen someone post cover art of covering artists' album. it is unheard of and rude. it is the only page for which i have ever seen this, and clearly it is your prerogative to promote Ben Folds and other horrible bands.
The bottom line is that Elton John is a LEGEND, and I think what you're doing is no different than someone posting cover art for a boyband cover of a Beatles song; you would be eviscerated if you did something like that for a Beatles single, and I don't see why such evisceration should be spared when you're insulting arguably one of the best musicians in the past 50 years. Do not argue about whether this is an encyclopedia, argue the merit for why the cover art of inferior artists whose musical merit is far far far below that of the ORIGINAL artist. You can't, because you know they are inferior. instead you're using a BS """"freedom of information"""" argument to ruin the appeal of a great song. No one covers a song better than the original artist. For example: Oasis' cover of Street Fighting Man is unbelievable, but I would NEVER EVER go to the Rolling Stones' """"Street Fighting Man"""" single page and post Oasis' cover art, even though their merit is much closer to the Stones than Ben Folds is to Elton John. If you want to argue, let's argue. Don't go running and telling on me because I""""m removing edits that are not worthy. Deal with it, that's life kiddo.

Questions about the Belarusian position
I'm not quite sure about Belarusian ethnic lands - could you be more specifi, because we do have opinions that it was Lithuanian ethnic land, and also that it was Polish ethic lands.

Quoting from the rules..

Dealing with misuse of process

""""Unlike trolls who vandalize articles, the majority of the damage caused by those misusing process is indirect. Generally it is best to simply state your opposition and leave it at that. 

In many cases someone else has already gone through an explanation, and you can simply say you agree. If a nomination or listing is obviously going to fail, """"piling on"""" explanation after explanation or personally attacking the nominator is not going to change anything; the listing or nomination will fail anyway. 

If the number of listings starts getting excessive (even if they are on separate pages) then you might want to use the dispute resolution process. Dispute resolution does take a while, though. If the number of nominations/listing is very high the most damage will be done if there is no emergency block put in place. In general, let the process run. """"

This is one of those instances in which reductio ad absurdem is a helpful and persuasive rhetorical argument.  I get it.  I understand your point-of-view, and I'm sympathetic.  I'm not even disagreeing.  I only explain that disambiguation for the ships of the CP fleet is informed by a consensus:
(a) I understand that this consensus is not one which you unquestioningly accept. 
(b) You clarify the ambit of this """"consensus"""" by pointing to Wikipedia:Naming conventions (ships). 
You announce that your background has to do with articles about military ships, and this informs my measured and somewhat cautious response.  In the period in which I was more engaged in developing the articles about this relatively small fleet. I was not inattentive to the consequences of lexicographical order  see Taxonomy#Military taxonomy.  
 RMS Empress of China  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of China (1921)  disambiguation

Bottom line: I have not reverted nor disputed your recent move; but I'm disinclined to move too quickly in moving each article about a ship in this fleet again  see  here and  here; see also
 RMS Empress of Britain >  Empress of Britain  disambiguation
 RMS Empress of Britain (1930) >  Talk:RMS Empress of Britain (1931)#Redundant useful links

I don't quite understand the point-of-view which appears to argue that the distinction between military and non-military vessels should reasonably extend to this minor issue of disambiguation. Application of the phrase """"consensus reality"""" in our Wikipedia context is one of those  lessons learned the hard way.  I'm still investigating the nuance of unintended consequences.  

For example,  was moved by  to RMS Empress of Australia, and the disambiguation date was simply deemed unnecessary at this point.  This edit is entirely justified, of course; but the modification fails to take into account an article which has yet to be created about RMS Empress of Australia (1953).  As you know, this trivial misjudgment doesn't matter, if indeed the term """"misjudgment"""" can be applied at all  which perhaps makes it an excellent illustration of a grey area.

Hi  did you mean to call this article multifocal... instead of multiple...?  In any case, thanks for creating the article, and I hope you are going to turn it into prose  we don't really want articles that are merely outlines.
